# hello-world


Just getting started! My name is Valerie and I am in a situation where my roommates are starting their own "PROGRAM". This program is all about FRENCHIES!!! French Bulldogs to be exact. Everything from the breeding of them to home-made raw food for them. Currently, we are blessed to have 5 in the program, non of which who have experienced breeding, they are all still babes. Ranging from 6months to only a few months old. This is where it begins. Any advice on the making, grinding, (they have an industrial grade meat grinder) recipies for all raw batches of dog food are greatly encouraged!!! Thank you and let's create the best all natural dog food recipes for these 5, 4-legged furry frenchie friends <3 

Any donations are greatly appreciated!!! These doggies and making there food is very pricey, any and all donations go directly to these pups and the #1 goal of creating the best-raw, heart healthy food!!! I will be updating with pictures and recipies of our own, success and failure recipies and heart-warming photos of the fab 5 frenchies :)
